This article is a shameful copy of the great [Grav original page](http://learn.getgrav.org/content/markdown).

If you want to know about the extended Markdown syntax of **LoveIt** theme, please read [extended Markdown syntax page](../theme-documentation-content#extended-markdown-syntax).

Let's face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. 

**Markdown** is a better way to write **HTML**, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.

Some of the key benefits are:

1. Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it's also quicker to write content.
2. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown.
3. Produces valid XHTML output.

John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible.
> While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters,
> the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.
>
> {{< style "text-align: right;" >}}-- _John Gruber_{{< /style >}}

Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!
